    TIPS

    - use the darken + to to apply a darker color you currently have selected

        - this works with the random color selection as well!
        - each time you press the darken + button it gets darker
        - switch to normal color value by choosing the random or color picker tool

    - the grid is flexible and works on mobile

        - The grid input amount does not reflect the number of squares in a row.
        - example: 16 would create a grid that has 16x16 number of squares.
          It does not mean necessarily that the rows or columns will be 16 x 16 
          A choice of "16" means that there will be 16x16 = 256 squares in the grid. 
          The number of squares in the rows and columns depends on your screen size.
